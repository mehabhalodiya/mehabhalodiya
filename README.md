üë®‚Äçüíª  I am passionate about Kubernetes & I enjoy learning new things. </br>
üéØ 2022 Goal : Keep learning and keep contributing

### My Experience 

### ‚û§ [Google Summer of Code'22](https://summerofcode.withgoogle.com/programs/2022/projects/yHHRfVz2): </br>
<IMG SRC="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/8/85/GSoC-icon.svg" ALIGN="left" width="70" height="70" /> Selected as 1 of the 1,209 GSoC contributors from 62 countries for Google Summer of Code'22; there were over 4,000 applicants from 96 countries! I will develop open source software for Keptn. Particularly, I will be working on providing integration for GitOps based Deployment tools (e.g. ArgoCD/Flux) with Keptn.

### ‚û§ [LFX Mentee for Spring'22](https://mentorship.lfx.linuxfoundation.org/project/9e7f18e3-68ee-44f8-ac74-55e802fce8e3): </br>
<IMG SRC="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/e/ed/Linux_Foundation_Logo.svg" ALIGN="left" width="70" height="70" /> LFX mentorship is a program under CNCF which promotes adoption, innovation and sustainability of open source. I am learning and working on [Gateway API](https://github.com/kubernetes-sigs/gateway-api), which is an evolution of Kubernetes Ingress and Service networking that aims to upgrade and improve these APIs. 

### ‚û§ [Kubernetes 1.24 & 1.23 Release Team Shadow](https://github.com/kubernetes/sig-release/blob/master/releases/release-1.23/release-team.md): </br>

Shadows on the release team are equivalent to similar trainee positions on other teams. The idea is that Shadows learn by doing, while in the process of taking a load off the leads and improving the release. Honored to be a part of the team as they received 185 applications for 27 shadows roles.
